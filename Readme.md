# Ride-Sharing Microservices Platform

A production-oriented microservices architecture for a ride-sharing platform, implementing real-time driver matching, route optimization, and payment processing. Built with Go, gRPC, RabbitMQ, and deployed on Kubernetes.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform demonstrates modern backend engineering practices through a real-world use case: connecting riders with drivers in real-time. The system handles trip requests, calculates dynamic pricing, manages driver assignments, and processes payments—all while maintaining service isolation and scalability.

**Key Metrics:**
- 4 independent microservices communicating via gRPC
- 8 specialized message queues for event-driven workflows
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Integration with OSRM API for route calculation

### Infrastructure Components

- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker with topic exchange, durable queues, and dead letter exchange (DLX) for failed messages
- **MongoDB**: Document store for trips and fare calculations with geospatial indexing
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for request flow visualization and performance monitoring
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration with health checks, config management, and service discovery
- **Tilt**: Local development environment with hot reloading and automated builds

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Event-Driven Architecture
Implemented asynchronous message passing with RabbitMQ to decouple services and enable independent scaling. Events flow through specialized queues:
- `find_available_drivers` - Trip creation triggers driver search
- `driver_cmd_trip_request` - Commands sent to specific drivers
- `driver_trip_response` - Driver acceptance/decline responses
- Message durability ensures reliability during service restarts

### Real-Time Communication
Dual WebSocket endpoints (`/ws/drivers`, `/ws/riders`) provide bidirectional communication for live location updates and trip status changes. Connection pooling and heartbeat mechanisms maintain stable connections.

### Dynamic Pricing Engine
Multi-tier fare calculation considering:
- Base fare by vehicle type (SUV: $2.00, Sedan: $3.50, Van: $4.00, Luxury: $10.00)
- Distance-based pricing using OSRM route calculations
- Time-based components for duration estimates
- Extensible pricing configuration for surge pricing

### Geospatial Driver Matching
Efficient driver discovery using geohash spatial indexing. Proximity-based searches find available drivers within configurable radius, with fair dispatch preventing driver starvation.

### Observability & Monitoring
OpenTelemetry instrumentation across HTTP, gRPC, and database operations. Jaeger traces visualize request flows through microservices, helping identify bottlenecks and debug issues in distributed transactions.

### Graceful Degradation
Circuit breaker patterns, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and fallback responses ensure system resilience. Dead letter queues capture failed messages for manual recovery.
